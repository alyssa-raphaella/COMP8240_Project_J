RO_028,A lot can happen in 12 months John.
RO_029,Tonight you're here with me.
RO_030,My dad and I used to come out here. Lay down watch the lights change watch them go from green to red to yellow. You could try it if you wanted to.
RO_031,No.
RO_032,That's your problem. You don't do what you want.
RO_033,Okay. And what happens if a car comes?

RO_057,I hope you make the right choice.
RO_058,Gandhi said whatever you do in life will be insignificant. It's very important that you do.
RO_059,Officer those two we're just trying to stop it.
RO_060,Go home.
RO_061,I tend to agree with the first part.
RO_062, You could do worse than have a father who bails you out of jail.
RO_063,I don't want to be bailed out of anything.
RO_064,Why do you think that doesn't want to spend time with me.
RO_065,"She knows I'll take care of her, that's all there is Tyler."
RO_066,"That's all there is, not enough."
RO_067, You know you can't smoke in here.
RO_068,What? why do you have an ashtray?
RO_069,"It's a bowl, it completes the room."
RO_070, I guess it was just here to teach me.

RO_096,"You're kind of lost, don't you?"
RO_097,"You think you know me, you know."
RO_098,My dad just doesn't know what's going on right now.
RO_099,What's going on right now?
RO_100,"Someone's been trying to tell me something, make your yours forever. No marking on the forever part."
RO_101,You do not like this song.
RO_102,You have to turn it off.
RO_103,Please stop.
RO_104,"Life's all about moments of impact, but what if one day you could no longer remember any of them."
RO_105,Paige you're in the hospital you were in a car accident.
RO_106,Are you in any pain?
RO_107,My head hurts doctor.
RO_108,She doesn't remember me!
RO_109,Her memory is going to improve with time.
RO_110,Surprise!
RO_111,We miss you.
RO_112,"Coming home to life, I don't know that's a lot to take in."
RO_113,We'll figure this out together.
RO_114,Good morning.
RO_115,What?

RO_121,Jeremy.
RO_122,Been a long time.
RO_123,I need to make my wife fall in love with me again. I want to ask you out on a date.
RO_124,This is the exact parking spot where we first met.
RO_125,I know you remember what we were like together.
RO_126,"You like this, right?"
RO_127,I'm trying!
RO_128,To save what we have.
RO_129,I'm not trying to hurt you.
RO_130,"I miss our life together, I miss being with you."
RO_131,I hope one day I can love the way that you love me.
RO_132,"You figured it out once, you'll do it again."
RO_133,New York has lost its soul.
RO_134,He's decided to hate where he's from.
RO_135,There's a John Varvatos where CGB's used to be.
RO_136,That's true.
RO_137,New York's most vibrant neighborhood at the moment is Philadelphia.
RO_138,W.F. Gerald. I just moved into 2-b.
RO_139,Thomas Webb.
RO_140,"Why so troubled, Thomas?"
RO_141,I'm having a bad day.
RO_142,What's her name?
RO_143,I'm crazy about you.
RO_144,I'm crazy about you but...
RO_145,"But, don't say his friends."
RO_146,Why?! Why is that so bad?
RO_147,What you need to do just make her afraid of something more than being with you.
RO_148,Which is..
RO_149,Not being with you.
RO_150,How am I supposed to do that?
RO_151,"Let life take over, find a window and bounce."
RO_152,What's my father doing here?
RO_153,Who's he with?
RO_154, I don't know. It's not my mother.
RO_155,"That's her, the other woman."
RO_156,Excuse me! Do you know who I am?
RO_157,Yes I do.
RO_158,You do?
RO_159,You're the boy who follows me. You're also Ethan's son.
RO_160,"You think you're gonna steal him away from my mother, and get any man you want to sit."
RO_161,Could I get you?
RO_162,What?
RO_163,She's not like anyone I've ever met.
RO_164,People do things all the time without realizing.
RO_165,"Yeah, what am I doing?"
RO_166, You're trying to make love to me.
RO_167,I'm trying to make love to you?
RO_168,We're you?
RO_169,What kind of a question is that?
RO_170,She's a beautiful woman.
RO_171,She's sleeping with my father.
RO_172,You're being really obvious.
RO_173,You're an innocent Thomas and you've got no idea how the world works.
RO_174,I know some things.
RO_175,Like what?
RO_176,Did you sleep with her?
RO_177,Why do you care?
RO_178,In life what is it that you want?
RO_179,Is there anything I should know? Anything you want to tell me.
RO_180,You want something more here.
RO_181,Something more what?
RO_182,Provocative.
RO_183,Things have gotten messy.
RO_184," You are just like them. They won, Thomas."
RO_185,"I want to bail, but I can't."
RO_186,"But then you know, the only way out is truth."
RO_187,It's as random as it is deliberate. Funny as it is tragic.
RO_188,Yours is no exception.
