Two weeks together that's all it took two weeks for me to fall for you

Special forces, huh? Huh? 
Yes Sir.
Oh, you're on leave. I hope you're enjoying themself. 
Yeah, I think I am.
 
Full moon tonight. 
Actually doesn't matter where you are in the world, it's never bigger than your thumb.

Hey pop. Got somebody I want you to meet.

I like you're dad, he loves you. I can tell even if you can't.
