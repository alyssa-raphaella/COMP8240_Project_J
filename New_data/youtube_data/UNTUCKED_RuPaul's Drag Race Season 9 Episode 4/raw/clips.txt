Yes! Oh my God Shea and I won working together. Finally, a win! I am so happy, yes!
We've had three challenges, I've been safe the whole time. And while I feel confident that I've turned some really cool looks so far, being safe is a scary place 'cause you don t know if you're forgettable or if you're just doing well and coasting through the competition.

Clap slate.

Con-drag-ulations!
You guys literally almost had me pissing!
Pissing myself!
I think Farrah and I were like wetting ourselves underneath that desk. To the ladies of "Good Morning Bitches" and especially Shea and Sasha. Con-drag-ulations on your win!
Yes!
To Shea and Sasha!
Con-drag-ulations.
Ladies.
What a solid team. And also con-drag-ulations to Aja for picking such a good group of girls.
You picked the team, bitch!
Well honestly, this is a wake up call for me in so many ways. Like I've just felt so in my head and I feel so good right now, I listened to the critiques.
Look at you, you today, you look--
You look beautiful!
You look like you're not--you're not afraid of your face.
Yeah.
And trying to hide it. You are so beautiful and you are just like accentuating that in the full, true queen that you are.
It's just really hard to like embrace like my natural features because like all my life I've just been told that I was ugly for my natural features. And when I first started doing drag like, you know, like if I were to paint like a face like Farrah's or Valentina's is very soft and blended, people come up to me and be like "Oh what are you doing? Like you look ugly. Like nothing's gonna help that face, like oh you need fillers. Oh you need this, you need that." Like you know, people would make fun of my skin. And like my scars.
I've always struggled with the idea of beauty. Because there's such a pressure to fit a certain image. And the reality is, we don t have to fit the image. Beauty has no identity, so I have to feel confident and maybe channel that in myself.
Now Shea, you've been in the top before and now you have your first win. How does that feel?
Yes!
It feels really good because last week I was in a dark place. Being that constructing clothes is like you know, my trade. I at least wanted to be in the top. And then to just be safe, I was like-- And I didn t even look on the bright side that I was at least moving forward in the competition. It wasn t like I was lip syncing. You know what I'm saying?
We're all ambitious.
Yeah.
So it's all about perspective and I think that as long as we can all maintain that and realize that we are like here for a reason that we just have to do our best. I think that we'll all be really successful going forward in the competition.
I agree.


It sucks to be "Not On Today".
Y'all, "Not On Today" is not on today.
It's cancelled!
Ladies, um... Isn't it weird to think that two people from that team are lip syncing against each other?
That's deep.
Which, which two do y'all--
Well we didn t see them in the challenge.
Yeah! That's the thing that sucks.
Who was squirming the most?
Oh, Peppermint's runway!
Peppermint's runway is rough.
Peppermint is in deep shit you guys, and I'm sad about it.
Me too.
I don t think she prepared for this look though.
She didn t, it was an after thought.
She literally looks like Taraji P. Henson from "Baby Boy".
Oh!
Like where you been at?
Let me smell yo dick!
Yep.
Yeah!
You know, y'all know the scene.
Who was Peppermint paired with?
Trinity.
Peppermint was paired with Trinity.
Oh shit.
And I heard Trinity was a dictator of a leader. She didn t let anyone decide what they liked. She was like "This is gonna be you, this is gonna be you. And if you want to talk, you have to raise your hand."
I'm also gonna say, if we're talking about like taste, level, and looks, Trinity's wasn t my favorite look tonight. And today is not my favorite day for Nina, either.
Oh that runway.
I love it!
Do you really?
I really do!
I just feel like for Naughty Nighties like such a sexy category why are you going out looking like a zombie?
When I saw her paint teeth on her face that's when I was just like, what's gon' happen?
No one else would ever think of that!
Yeah but I'm not clocking her for being different, I'm clocking it because it's executed poorly.
My general consensus about that team's looks on the runway tonight is very indicative of the way I felt about their--
Eureka!
Their morning show looks. Is that they were a bit all over the place.
Bitch!
They're not in the same universe at all.
They look like a college a community college morning show on channel number three that can't make it on the morning so they play it at three a.m. You know what I'm saying? Like it was just a little bit rough around the edges.
Yeah.
And I was like just "Y'all, I don t know if I would want to watch that in the mornting when I wake up with my coffee." I be like, "Um."


Not just bigger, but thicker. You know what I'm saying? It's like a tree trunk!
Maybe your thighs are getting smaller.
Ladies, I have to ask something. And I hate to be morbid, yadda-yadda. But who do y'all think is gonna go home tonight?
Oh God.
Peppermint might be in trouble.
I don t want to think about it.
I don t want to see Peppermint go.
I don t either!
But I think she's in trouble.
'Cause I love Peppermint's energy so much.
I can't imagine this group of girls without her.
She's also, Sasha, a legend. Like I remember growing up in New York City. And I remember as a little like you know, middle schooler, high schooler, getting the free gay magazines and flipping through them and seeing Peppermint in the magazines. So she's like a legend on our season.
She is a legend.
I think Trinity might be in trouble 'cause she wasn t a good group leader.
This is also based on what we've heard.
Yeah.
I want to hear this coming out of the group and them.
Yeah, I'd like to hear things--
They've been gone for awhile!
They must be getting it really hard in there.


Ladies, what's the tea? Who's in the bottom?
What's going on?
Well, listen I'm gonna say my two piece 'cause I got to go untuck.
Lay it on us, Trinity.
Who were the anchors, who were the--
Me and her were the anchors.
Her and Cynthia--
Cucu and I were enter-taint-ment.
And then y'all were D.I.Y. okay.
So I want to clarify why I chose you to be- to go home.
Oh they asked you all that?!
At the end of the critiques.
I chose you because obviously, Eureka and Nina got really good critiques. So it was between us three. I knew me and her, we're going on the bottom two. I chose you because you're not. Like, there's no way they're gonna--
So she was like a throwaway.
Right.
Because they're not gonna choose her.
Eureka.
Well I chose Trinity 'cause she was our team captain. Also because of the critiques that they got as anchors. And I chose you over Peppermint only because to me, as a leader, you automatically get more responsibility for something going wrong, especially if it's your group. You see what I'm saying?
I'm not upset that you picked me at all. I completely--
Well you retaliated like you were pretty upset.
If you would let me finish. I take responsibility for the things that I did wrong in our segment. But what I don t agree with, and what I think you're very shady about--
It's not shady if it's true.
You said that I was not a good leader. I was a good leader, yes we ran out of time and we did not get to do it all together. But that wasn t just my fault, we were working as a team. That is why you're shady.
Am I shady?
You are shady.
Because I feel like you want to immediately want to go to shady versus stepping up and accepting responsibility.
You're making it about something else that it's not.
When we sat down, I felt like it was, "Well me and Peppermint are the anchors, they're gonna do this 'cause they want to do that. Nina, Eureka, y'all are dong D.I.Y."
No, I said--
No I'm not done, I'm not done.
No. You're done because I'm gonna tell you why you're done. I explained exactly why I picked you for that role and Cucu for that role.
But see, you're not hearing yourself saying "I picked. I picked."
They could have objected and we could have talked it out. So don't stand on the stage and say I didn t do my job because I did.
When did you come over and check on what we were doing?
That I should take responsibility and I should be on the bottom because I'm the leader, I can do that. But don t say I didn t do my job!
I felt like I wasn t included. You and Peppermint-- You always think you're not included! You think I don t know, I know you.
You don t know me baby! I didn t get a chance to explain my reasoning for saying what I said so I'm going to now. If she doesn t want to listen, she doesn t have to.
I'm gonna go.
Okay.
You guys enjoy.
Thank you.
You guys enjoy.
Thank you.
Did you not feel comfortable with the role that you were assigned?
I was comfortable with our role after it happened. But, regardless of the situation, our entire time we worked on our stuff, we were alone in our pairs. Do you not agree?
We were.
We were.
I do not remember Trinity walking up to me, asking me if I was doing okay, how our skit was going, what's it sound like--
I think you were gone at the time.
She did. She did, once.
Well she didn t to me.
She did to us, once.
Nina Bo' Nina Rob Zombie Brown. How did you feel?
Help me up, oh hold on. Oh!
You broke your back, girl?
Sit up, sit up, girl.
Girl!
Hungry, hungry hip pads.
Your hip pads got you girl?!
Somebody has to be the messy one. Um she was a good captain. But we didn t really feel included sometimes.
And I mean, we had a conversation about that together. So it wasn t me just trying to attack Trinity. It was literally, you two, you two, you two that's it.
In retrospect, I agree that it was time management that was the issue. Because if we had run it a few more times around the table, we would ve realized that at the end of the interview segment...
We have to say goodbye.
...That we had to say goodbye. And that it was up to, it was up to one of the co-anchors to say, "Well that's all the time we have. Thank you very much Naya. And thank you for joining us on 'Not On Today'."

Oh.
Well she successfully was put back into place, honey.
Trinity, I want to know if you like actually cared about what your group thought and let them pick what they wanted to do. Because our group, we did so well because Aja let us read through all the parts and like pick what we felt like we would be strong as. We all did parts that we related to.
'Cause the word that was thrown around in the work room, and I'm just gonna be real, was that you were a dictator.
Yeah.
Well this is the part about being a leader, is that you have to make decisions. So I made decisions based on the personalities of the people and what I thought that they would excel at. She obviously is a crafty queen. She makes sickening stuff out of paper. Why would she not excel in that aspect?
You did say that.
I knew that her personality with the way Eureka's personality is, they would be able to interact really well together. She is--
And you were right.
And I was right.
It just sounds like dictator-y.
I think it's your look. You have a very serious like bitch, don t fuck with me.
I've got fifty units of Botox in my face girl! I don t know what y'all want from me.

Even though I was scared being there, I'm glad I finally got some critique.
To just hear stuff.
Right, right, to hear something. So it was good to hear something. But girl just being in there girl for all that time.
In your feet.
No ma'am.
In that tiny, tiny little waist.
This heavy ass body girl--
My God.
Alexis, this heavy body on these skinny legs is hard to hold up, bitch.
Do you see, I could practically fit my hands about you. And I can't even reach around this way!
I can't, I can't, girl. Girl. Girl. I can't, girl. I can't. I can't. Where's Valentina at?

I know, I understand like it must be difficult like to be in the positon you're in. But like, girl just--
I'm completely relaxed. 'Cause this is the thing-
Yeah.
I really believe that everything happens for a reason. And if I'm meant to go home then I'm gonna go home.
I know but I know. But you say you're relaxed but you just seem like you're like coming off strong.
I am, but that's just my personality. I am very stand offish. It's taken a lot for me to open up to people. I am very like "don't talk to me". Not that I mean it that way, but that's how I- how I come across the way I look to people. People don t know where I came from. People don't know the things that I've been through in my life to make me the way that I am. So it's something I struggle with everyday. I try.
If it means anything to you, like I can't say I have completely walked in your shoes but I can say that I do understandlike how it is to kind of carry, like I came here carrying a lot of weight on my shoulders with a lot of different things back at home. And I know like I was in the bottom last week and it really sucks.
Right.
But just don't overthink it.
If I stay, that's something that I'm definitely going to carry over to the next part of the competition is not overthinking stuff.
