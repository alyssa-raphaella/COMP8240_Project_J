DY001,Hilary O'Neil had little experience and a lot of possibility.
DY002,do you know anything about chemotherapy.
DY003,well I need help during it.
DY004,so why would you pick me? Oh.. I got it. I had this shortest skirt, huh?
DY005,oh actually no there was one with a shorter skirt but he was never a candy striper.
DY006,Victor at all life could offer except the one thing he needed.
DY007,I don't think I can deal with this.
DY008,I'm not going to die, I am going to recover but I can't do it without help, I can't do it without you.
DY009,for them the best medicine in life is knowing that there's hope.
DY010,we deserve an adventure.
DY011,why don't you drive? 
DY012,no please don't do that Hilary.
DY013,he's very sick and I don't know how to help him.
DY014,Where's my son?
DY015,I think you need to come get him now.
DY016,I'd like to hide away here, too, with a beautiful girl. It's the enchanted cottage.
DY017,I'm taking you back.
DY018,Do you love me?
DY019,What?
DY020,Just tell me. 
DY021,You want me to tell you I love you? Then you can say, "Well, great. Now I'm gonna die and I'm gonna leave you."
DY022,Do you think I want to die ? 
DY023,I need a life. I have a life with you. 
DY024,Most people live a lifetime and never love like this.
