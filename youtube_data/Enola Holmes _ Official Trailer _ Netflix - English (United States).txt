Now, where to begin?

My mother named me Enola…

which, backwards, 

spells "alone."

And yet, 

we were always together.

And it was wonderful.

She was my whole world.

Which leads me to the second

thing you need to know.

A week ago, I awoke…

Mother?

…to find that my mother

was missing,

and she did not return.

I'm presently on the way

to collect my brothers,

Mycroft and Sherlock.

Yes, Sherlock Holmes,

the famous detective,

my genius brother.

-He will have all the answers.

-Enola.

-Where's your hat and gloves?

-Well, I have a hat.

It just makes my head itch,

and I have no gloves.

My God.

A wild woman brought up

a wild child.

We'll make her acceptable

for society.

She seems intelligent.

There are two paths

you can take, Enola,

yours or the path

others choose for you.

It is time to find my mother.

The game is afoot.

If I have to stay hidden

from my brothers…

I must become something…

unexpected.

A lady.

You've progressed nicely.

-Is she safe?

-She's had company.

-I'm Viscount Tewkesbury.

-A useless boy.

You have to help me.

I'm not ready to die on a train.

I'm not ready to die at all,

and I wasn't going to 

before I met you!

What are you planning,

Mother?

She always had a reason

for everything…

her own way of doing things.

Perhaps she wants 

to change the world.

Perhaps it's a world

that needs changing.

Up, come on!

Unlike most well-bred ladies,

I was never taught

to embroider.

I was taught

to watch… and listen.

I was taught to fight.

I'm coming

to find you, Mother.

You don't know how

to embroider?
