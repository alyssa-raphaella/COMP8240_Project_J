Two weeks together that's all it took two weeks for me to fall for you

Special forces, huh? Huh? 
Yes Sir.
Oh, you're on leave. I hope you're enjoying themself. 
Yeah, I think I am.
 
Full moon tonight. 
Actually doesn't matter where you are in the world, it's never bigger than your thumb.

Hey pop. Got somebody I want you to meet.

I like you're dad, he loves you. I can tell even if you can't.

+ + + + +

The way people act around you it's like they're scared of you.

Want you to get your hands off me.

What if you're scared of what I used to be. 
You don't scare me John. 
Well you scare me.

I gotta go back.
Just like that. 
So where are they gonna send you? Right in the middle of it all?

I'll see you soon.  
I'll see you soon then.

+ + + + +

Dear John, tell me everything write it all down. That way. We'll be with each other all the time, even if we're not with each other at all. 

It's a full moon here tonight, which makes me think of you. Half a world away.

Letter number 8.
Letter number 33.
Dear John. 
I miss you so much. It hurts

Request for permission to extend my tour sir. 

You've decided you're going back.

All I know is I want to stay here with you as long as I possibly can and I need you to tell me, I don't...

A lot can happen in 12 months John. 

Tonight you're here with me.

My dad and I used to come out here

Lay down watch the lights change watch them go from green to red to yellow. 
You could try it if you wanted to.
No.
That's your problem. You don't do what you want.
Okay

And what happens if a car comes?
We die.

** Some of  romances, there'r shooting stars
Spectacular moment of light from the heavens. 

You just tell what you want I'm gonna be that for you.

Leaving glimpse of eternity.

It is 2:00 in the morning we sent the police. 
Mrs. Hamilton, all of these is my fault. 

He's a nice boy, but he's...
He's what?
He is trash trash trash not for you. 

If you are not to see him anymore, and that's fine.

+ + + + + 

** He understands, it's hard, but he really does.

Moods of plantation, dream house, would be able to get it now?

I think a lot about why we should get married. I love you, marry me.

Hello.

We really loved each other did't we.

I hope you make the right choice.

Gandhi said whatever you do in life will be insignificant.

It's very important that you do. 
Officer those two we're just trying to stop it.
Go home.

I tend to agree with the first part. 
You could do worse than have a father who bails you out of jail.
I don't want to be bailed out of anything.

Why do you think that doesn't want to spend time with me.
She knows I'll take care of her, that's all there is Tyler.

That's all there is, not enough.

+ + + + +

You know you can't smoke in here.

What? why do you have an ashtray? 
It's a bowl, it completes the room. 
I guess it was just here to teach me.

You put it ghost a past couple of weeks, all right. You didn't want to go out any more.

I had enough of this introvert stuff, okay. I already set an intervention here.

He had got a daughter.
Who's got a daughter?
The cop that busted your face all up, he's got a daughter.

I know her she's in my global politics class.
Go get her.

+ + + + +

I I don't date sociology majors.
Lucky for you, I'm I'm undecided. 
About what?
Of everything.

What desserts do you have? 
I have my dessert first.

What is that? 
This is our appetizer.
That's my chicks dig...
You man they love this freaky pointed crap.

Charles it's your son.

Yeah, I was wondering if you wanna have dinner. 
How many? 
Three.

Can stand me up, but he can't stand you up.

+ + + + +

You gonna take care of nothing! You're irresponsible for no one! You're a kid!

I'm going out.
Where are you going?

A boy from school.
You're kind of lost, don't you? 
You think you know me, you know.

My dad just doesn't know what's going on right now. 
What's going on right now?

Someone's been trying to tell me something, make your yours forever. No marking on the forever part.

** You do not like this song.

** You have to turn it off.

Please stop.

Life's all about moments of impact, but what if one day you could no longer remember any of them. 

Paige you're in the hospital you were in a car accident.
Are you in any pain? 
My head hurts doctor.

She doesn't remember me! 
Her memory is going to improve with time.

Surprise!

We miss you. 
Coming home to life, I don't know that's a lot to take in. 
We'll figure this out together.

+ + + + +

Good morning.

What?
Please knock. 
This's habit, I'm sorry

The last memory that I have is being engaged to Jeremy.

Hi.
Hi. I'm sorry. This is ah...
Jeremy. 
Been a long time.

I need to make my wife fall in love with me again. I want to ask you out on a date.

this is the exact parking spot where we first met. 

+ + + + +

I know you remember what we were like together. 

You like this, right?

I'm trying!

To save what we have. 

I'm not trying to hurt you. 
I miss our life together, I miss being with you.

I hope one day I can love the way that you love me. 
You figured it out once, you'll do it again.

New York has lost its soul.

He's decided to hate where he's from.
There's a John Varvatos where CGB's used to be. 

That's true. 
New York's most vibrant neighborhood at the moment is Philadelphia.

W.F. Gerald. I just moved into 2-b.
Thomas Webb.
Why so troubled, Thomas?
I'm having a bad day.

What's her name?

I'm crazy about you. 
I'm crazy about you but... 
But, don't say his friends. 
Why?! Why is that so bad? 

+ + + + +

What you need to do just make her afraid of something more than being with you
Which is.. 
Not being with you.

How am I supposed to do that?

Let life take over, find a window and bounce.

What's my father doing here?
Who's he with?
I dont know. It's not my mother.

That's her, the other woman. 

Excuse me! Do you knwo who I am?
Yes I do.
You do?
You're the boy who follows me. You're also Ethan's son.

+ + + + +

You think you're gonna steal him away from my mother, and get any man you want to sit.

Could I get you?

What?

She's not like anyone I've ever met.

People do things all the time without realising. 

Yeah, what am I doing?

You're trying to make love to me. 

I'm trying to make love to you?

We're you?

What kind of a question is that? 
She's a beautiful woman. 
She's sleeping with my father. 
You're being really obvious.

You're an innocent Thomas and you've got no idea how the world works. 
I know some things.
Like what?

+ + + + +

Did you sleep with her?
Why do you care? 

In life what is it that you want?

Is there anything I should know? Anything you want to tell me.

You want something more here.
Something more what?
Provocative. 

Things have gotten messy.

You are just like them. They won, Thomas. 

I want to bail, but I can't. 

But then you know, the only way out is truth.

It's as random as it is deliberate. Funny as it is tragic.

Yours is no exception.
