The way people act around you it's like they're scared of you.

Want you to get your hands off me.

What if you're scared of what I used to be. 
You don't scare me John. 
Well you scare me.

I gotta go back.
Just like that. 
So where are they gonna send you? Right in the middle of it all?

I'll see you soon.  
I'll see you soon then.
