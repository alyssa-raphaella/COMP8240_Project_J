Dear John, tell me everything write it all down. That way. We'll be with each other all the time, even if we're not with each other at all. 

It's a full moon here tonight, which makes me think of you. Half a world away.

Letter number 8.
Letter number 33.
Dear John. 
I miss you so much. It hurts

Request for permission to extend my tour sir. 

You've decided you're going back.

All I know is I want to stay here with you as long as I possibly can and I need you to tell me, I don't...

A lot can happen in 12 months John. 

Tonight you're here with me.
