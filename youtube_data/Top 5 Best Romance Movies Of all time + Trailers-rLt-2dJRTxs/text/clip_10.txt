I'm going out.
Where are you going?

A boy from school.
You're kind of lost, don't you? 
You think you know me, you know.

My dad just doesn't know what's going on right now. 
What's going on right now?

Someone's been trying to tell me something, make your yours forever. No marking on the forever part.
