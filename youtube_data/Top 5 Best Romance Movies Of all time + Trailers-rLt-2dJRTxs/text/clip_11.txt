You do not like this song.

You have to turn it off.

Please stop.

Life's all about moments of impact, but what if one day you could no longer remember any of them. 

Paige you're in the hospital you were in a car accident.
Are you in any pain? 
My head hurts doctor.

She doesn't remember me! 
Her memory is going to improve with time.

Surprise!

We miss you. 
Coming home to life, I don't know that's a lot to take in. 
We'll figure this out together.
