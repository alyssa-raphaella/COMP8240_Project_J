[Director] 

To the main stage.

All cameras repo.

[RuPaul] 

Shea Coule√©.

Sasha Velour.

Con-drag-ulations, you're

both the winners

of this week's challenge.

Team "Good Morning Bitches"

you are all safe.

You may leave the stage.

[upbeat tune]

Yes!

[Sasha] Oh my God Shea and I won

working together.

Finally, a win!

I am so happy,

yes!

[music continues]

[Alexis] We've had three

challenges, I've been safe

the whole time.

And while I feel confident

that I've turned some

really cool looks so far,

being safe is a scary place

'cause you don t know if

you're forgettable

or if you're just doing

well and coasting

through the competition.

[music continues]

Clap slate.

[indistinct conversation]

-All right girls!

-Good morning bitches!

-Morning bitches!

-We're winning bitches!

-   Con-drag-ulations!

-You guys literally almost

had me pissing!

-Pissing myself!

I think Farrah and I were

like wetting ourselves

underneath that desk.

To the ladies of

"Good Morning Bitches"

and especially Shea

and Sasha.

Con-drag-ulations

on your win!

-Yes!

-To Shea and Sasha!

- Con-drag-ulations.

-Ladies.

What a solid team.

And also   con-drag-ulations

to Aja for picking

such a good group

of girls.

-You picked the team,

bitch!

-Well honestly, this is a

wake up call for me

in so many ways.

Like I've just felt so

in my head and I feel so good

right now, I listened to

the critiques.

-Look at you, you today, 

you look--

-You look beautiful!

-You look like you're not--

you're not afraid

of your face.

-Yeah.

-And trying to hide it.

You are so beautiful and you

are just like accentuating

that in the full,

true queen that you are.

-It's just really hard

to like embrace

like my natural features

because like all my life

I've just been told that

I was ugly

for my natural features.

And when I first started

doing drag like,

you know, like if I were

to paint like a face

like Farrah's or Valentina's

is very soft and blended,

people come up to me

and be like

"Oh what are you doing?

Like you look ugly.

Like nothing's gonna

help that face,

like oh you need fillers.

Oh you need this,

you need that."

Like you know, people

would make fun of my skin.

And like my scars.

I've always struggled

with the idea of beauty.

Because there's such a

pressure to fit a certain image.

And the reality is, we

don t have to fit the image.

Beauty has no identity,

so I have to feel confident

and maybe channel that

in myself.

-Now Shea, you've been

in the top before

and now you have your

first win.

How does that feel?

-Yes!

-It feels really good

because last week

I was in a dark place.

Being that constructing clothes

is like you know, my trade.

I at least wanted to

be in the top.

And then to just be safe,

I was like--

[growls]

And I didn t even look on

the bright side

that I was at least moving

forward in the competition.

It wasn t like I was

lip syncing.

You know what I'm

saying?

-We're all ambitious.

-Yeah.

So it's all about

perspective and I think

that as long as we can

all maintain that

and realize that we are like

here for a reason

that we just have to do

our best.

I think that we'll all be

really successful

going forward in the

competition.

-I agree.

-It sucks to be

"Not On Today".

-Y'all, "Not On Today"

is not on today.

-It's cancelled!

-Ladies, um...

Isn't it weird to think

that two people

from that team are lip

syncing against each other?

-That's deep.

-Which, which two

do y'all--

-Well we didn t see them

in the challenge.

-Yeah! That's the thing

that sucks.

-Who was squirming

the most?

-Oh, Peppermint's

runway!

-Peppermint's runway

is rough.

Peppermint is in deep

[bleep] you guys,

and I'm sad about it.

-Me too.

-I don t think she

prepared for this look though.

-She didn t, it was an

after thought.

-She literally looks like

Taraji P. Henson

from "Baby Boy".

-Oh!

-Like where you been at?

Let me smell yo dick!

-Yep.

-Yeah!

-You know, y'all know

the scene.

-Who was Peppermint

paired with?

-Trinity.

-Peppermint was paired with

Trinity.

-Oh [bleep].

-And I heard Trinity

was a dictator of a leader.

She didn t let anyone

decide what they liked.

She was like "This is

gonna be you,

this is gonna be you.

And if you want to talk,

you have to raise your hand."

-I'm also gonna say, if

we're talking about

like taste, level,

and looks,

Trinity's wasn t my

favorite look tonight.

And today is not my favorite

day for Nina, either.

Oh that runway.

-I love it!

-Do you really?

-I really do!

-I just feel like for

Naughty Nighties

like such a sexy category

why are you going out

looking like a zombie?

-When I saw her paint

teeth on her face

that's when I was just

like, what's gon' happen?

-No one else would ever

think of that!

-Yeah but I'm not clocking

her for being different,

I'm clocking it because

it's executed poorly.

My general consensus

about that team's looks

on the runway tonight is

very indicative of the way

I felt about their--

-Eureka!

-Their morning show looks.

Is that they were a bit

all over the place.

-Bitch!

-They're not in the

same universe at all.

-They look like a college

a community college

morning show on

channel number three

that can't make it on

the morning

so they play it at

three a.m.

You know what I'm saying?

Like it was just a little

bit rough around the edges.

-Yeah.

-And I was like just "Y'all,

I don t know

if I would want to watch

that in the   mornting

when I wake up with

my coffee."

I be like, "Um."

[indistinct chatter]

Not just bigger,

but thicker.

You know what I'm

saying?

It's like a tree trunk!

-Maybe your thighs are

getting smaller.

[chuckles]

Ladies, I have to ask

something.

And I hate to be morbid,

yadda-yadda.

But who do y'all think is

gonna go home tonight?

-Oh God.

-Peppermint might be

in trouble.

-I don t want to think

about it.

-I don t want to see

Peppermint go.

-I don t either!

But I think she's

in trouble.

-'Cause I love Peppermint's

energy so much.

-I can't imagine this

group of girls without her.

-She's also, Sasha,

a legend.

Like I remember growing

up in New York City.

And I remember as

a little like you know,

middle schooler, high

schooler,

getting the free gay

magazines and

flipping through them and

seeing Peppermint

in the magazines.

So she's like a legend

on our season.

-She is a legend.

-I think Trinity might

be in trouble

'cause she wasn t a good

group leader.

-This is also based on

what we've heard.

-Yeah.

-I want to hear this coming

out of the group and them.

Yeah, I'd like to

hear things--

-They've been gone

for awhile!

-They must be getting it

really hard in there.

Thank you, ladies.

Thank you for your

honesty.

While you untuck

backstage,

the judges and I will

deliberate.

We've all had that

fantasy.

[laughter]

-Every time I'm just

like man

I'm gonna suck her dick

so hard.

-All that dressing and that

cranberry sauce!

-Thanksgiving dinner,

bitch!

-Hey ladies!

-Hey ladies!

-Y'all were gone forever!

-It felt like forever too, girl.

-You want to do it again?

-That was more fun than

a colostomy.

-Ladies, what's the tea?

Who's in the bottom?

-What's going on?

-Well, listen I'm gonna say

my two piece

'cause I got to go untuck.

-Lay it on us, Trinity.

-Who were the anchors,

who were the--

-Me and her were the

anchors.

-Her and Cynthia--

-Cucu and I were

enter-taint-ment.

-And then y'all were

D.I.Y. okay.

-So I want to clarify why

I chose you to be-

to go home.

-Oh they asked you

all that?!

-At the end of the

critiques.

-I chose you because

obviously, Eureka and Nina

got really good critiques.

So it was between

us three.

I knew me and her, we're going

on the bottom two.

I chose you because

you're not.

Like, there's no way

they're gonna--

-So she was like a

throwaway.

-Right.

Because they're not gonna

choose her.

-Eureka.

-Well I chose Trinity 'cause

she was our team captain.

Also because of the critiques

that they got as anchors.

And I chose you over

Peppermint

only because to me, as

a leader,

you automatically get more

responsibility

for something going wrong,

especially if it's your group.

You see what I'm saying?

-I'm not upset that you

picked me at all.

I completely--

-Well you retaliated like

you were pretty upset.

-If you would let

me finish.

I take responsibility

for the things

that I did wrong in

our segment.

But what I don t agree with,

and what I think

you're very shady about--

-It's not shady if it's true.

-You said that I was not

a good leader.

I was a good leader,

yes we ran out of time

and we did not get to

do it all together.

But that wasn t just

my fault,

we were working as

a team.

That is why you're shady.

-Am I shady?

-You are shady.

-Because I feel like you

want to immediately

want to go to shady versus

stepping up

and accepting

responsibility.

-You're making it about

something else that it's not.

-When we sat down, I felt

like it was,

"Well me and Peppermint

are the anchors,

they're gonna do this

'cause they want to do that.

Nina, Eureka, y'all are

dong D.I.Y."

-No, I said--

-No I'm not done,

I'm not done.

-No.

You're done because I'm

gonna tell you why you're done.

I explained exactly why

I picked you

for that role and Cucu

for that role.

-But see, you're not hearing

yourself saying

"I picked. I picked."

-They could have objected

and we could have talked

it out.

So don't stand on the

stage and say

I didn t do my job

because I did.

-When did you come over

and check on

what we were doing?

-That I should take

responsibility

and I should be on the

bottom because I'm the leader,

I can do that.

But don t say I didn t

do my job!

-I felt like I wasn t

included.

You and Peppermint--

-You always think you're

not included!

You think I don t know,

I know you.

-You don t know me baby!

I didn t get a chance to

explain my reasoning

for saying what I

said so I'm going to now.

If she doesn t want to listen,

she doesn t have to.

-I'm gonna go.

-Okay.

-You guys enjoy.

-Thank you.

-You guys enjoy.

-Thank you.

-Did you not feel

comfortable with the role

that you were assigned?

-I was comfortable with

our role after it happened.

But, regardless of

the situation,

our entire time we

worked on our stuff,

we were alone in our

pairs.

Do you not agree?

-We were.

-We were.

-I do not remember Trinity

walking up to me,

asking me if I was

doing okay,

how our skit was going,

what's it sound like--

-I think you were gone

at the time.

-She did.

She did, once.

-Well she didn t to me.

-She did to us, once.

-Nina Bo' Nina Rob

Zombie Brown.

How did you feel?

-Help me up, oh hold on.

Oh!

-You broke your back, girl?

-Sit up, sit up, girl.

-Girl!

-Hungry, hungry hip pads.

-Your hip pads got

you girl?!

-Somebody has to be

the messy one.

Um she was a good

captain.

But we didn t really feel

included sometimes.

-And I mean, we had a

conversation

about that together.

So it wasn t me just trying

to attack Trinity.

It was literally, you two, you

two, you two that's it.

-In retrospect, I agree

that it was time

management that was

the issue.

Because if we had run it

a few more times

around the table, we would ve

realized that at the end

of the interview segment...

-We have to say

goodbye.

-...That we had to say

goodbye.

And that it was up to,

it was up to one

of the co-anchors to say,

"Well that's all the

time we have.

Thank you very much Naya.

And thank you for joining us

on 'Not On Today'."

-Regardless, two of us 

are lip syncing.

-Who was it Nina?

Who was it, Nina?

Who was it?

-You could grab my toe!

You know, I'm messy

too, bitch!

I'm messy with you.

Whisper it in my ear.

[indistinct chatter]

-Oh.

-Well she successfully was put

back into place, honey.

-Trinity, I want to know

if you like actually cared

about what your group

thought and let them pick

what they wanted to do.

Because our group, we

did so well

because Aja let us

read through all the parts

and like pick what we felt like

we would be strong as.

We all did parts that we

related to.

-'Cause the word that

was thrown around

in the work room,

and I'm just gonna be real,

was that you were a

dictator.

-Yeah.

-Well this is the part about

being a leader,

is that you have to

make decisions.

So I made decisions based

on the personalities

of the people and what

I thought

that they would excel at.

She obviously is a

crafty queen.

She makes sickening stuff

out of paper.

Why would she not excel

in that aspect?

-You did say that.

-I knew that her personality

with the way Eureka's

personality is, they would

be able to interact

really well together.

She is--

-And you were right.

-And I was right.

-It just sounds like

dictator-y.

-I think it's your look.

You have a very serious

like bitch,

don t [bleep] with me.

-I've got fifty units of

Botox in my face girl!

[laughter]

I don t know what y'all

want from me.

[indistinct chatter]

-Even though I was scared

being there,

I'm glad I finally got

some critique.

-To just hear stuff.

-Right, right, to hear

something.

So it was good to hear

something.

But girl just being in there

girl for all that time.

-In your feet.

-No ma'am.

-In that tiny, tiny

little waist.

-This heavy ass body girl--

-My God.

-Alexis, this heavy body

on these skinny legs

is hard to hold up,

bitch.

-Do you see, I could practically

fit my hands about you.

And I can't even reach

around this way!

-I can't, I can't, girl.

Girl.

Girl.

I can't, girl.

I can't.

I can't.

Where's Valentina at?

-I know, I understand like

it must be difficult

like to be in the positon

you're in.

But like, girl just--

-I'm completely relaxed.

'Cause this is the thing-

-Yeah.

-I really believe that

everything happens for a reason.

And if I'm meant to go home

then I'm gonna go home.

-I know but I know.

But you say you're relaxed

but you just seem like

you're like coming off

strong.

-I am, but that's just my

personality.

I am very stand offish.

It's taken a lot for me

to open up to people.

I am very like "don't talk

to me".

Not that I mean it that way,

but that's how I-

how I come across

the way I look to people.

People don t know where

I came from.

People don't know the

things that I've been through

in my life to make me

the way that I am.

So it's something I struggle

with everyday.

I try.

-If it means anything to

you, like I can't say

I have completely walked

in your shoes

but I can say that I

do understand

like how it is to kind

of carry,

like I came here carrying a

lot of weight on my shoulders

with a lot of different things

back at home.

And I know like I was

in the bottom last week

and it really sucks.

-Right.

-But just don't

overthink it.

-If I stay, that's something

that I'm definitely going

to carry over to the next

part of the competition

is not overthinking stuff.

-Ladies, five-minute

warning.

Five-minute warning to

main stage.

[whimsical music]

There's so much going

through my head  .

I think everybody is thinking,

it's gonna be Trinity

and Peppermint lip syncing.

But I know that if I'm

in the bottom two,

then I'm going home because

I'm not a lip sync performer.

So I hope, like Bianca, to

get all the way through

to the end without

ever having to lip sync.

[suspenseful music]

There's a lot of girls in

this competition

that when they get in

this position,

they just give up.

That's not me.

When I'm faced with

something that is hard,

I get stronger and I

work harder.

I deserve to be in

the bottom.

And maybe this is my

chance to show the judges

that I am an entertainer.

I'm not scared of

this lip sync,

this is what I do for

a living.

I lip sync, I perform,

and I'm confident

and I'm ready.

I'm just gonna take a

deep breath and lip sync

for my mother [bleep]

life.

'Cause I'm not going.

All right ladies!

It is time!

Come with me everyone!

Time to lip sync for

your life!

-What do you know about

it, Nicholas?

Girl, I'm telling you

this; if I get in the bottom,

these earrings are

coming off.

I'm taking this [bleep]

right off.

-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

If you need me, I can

hold them.

-I'll just put them

on the ground.

I mean it is what it is.

All right, ladies time

to walk over.

Let's go, let's go,

let's go!

[indistinct chatter]

[suspenseful music]

[RuPaul] 

Welcome back, ladies.

I've made some decisions.

Trinity Taylor.

Charlie Hides.

You are up for

elimination  .

Ladies, this is your

last chance.

Impress me, and save

yourself from elimination!

The time has come for you to

lip sync for your life!

[suspenseful music]

Ladies!

I have made my decision.

Trinity Taylor, shante

you stay.

Dame Charlie Hides,

London, Boston,

and now, the world.

Sashay away.

-Thank you, Ru.

It's been a pleasure,

girls.

Don't touch me.

[RuPaul]   Con-drag-ulations

my queens.

Oh, and remember, if you

can't love yourself,

how the hell you

gon' love somebody else!

Can get I get an amen 

up in herre?

[All]   Amen!

[RuPaul]  All right, now let the

music play!

[melancholy music]

[Charlie] This competition has

made me realize

that I don t have a killer

instinct to fight.

But I think that there are

some older broads like myself

who still have

something to offer.

The seasoned queens, the

drag mothers that

have inspired a lot of

these younger competitors

still have got amazing

talents.

And they should still think

there's a chance for them.

Anybody over forty should

be auditioning

and sending in a tape.

[music continues]

Just keep on working,

keep on working,

keep on believing.

Just because the dream

didn t come true right away

doesn t mean it's not

gonna come true.

[music continues]

Now I'm excited to be part

of this sorority

of amazingly talented

performers.

It's a very small number of

people who have shared

this incredible experience.

And I'm looking forward

to getting to know

them better outside of

this competition.

[sighs]

I'm gonna miss this crazy

[bleep] freezing fridge.

What a crazy run this

has been.

[sighs]

I don t know if anybody

noticed, but I've only worn

two pairs of shoes on

the runway,

I just kept on changing

them.

Decorating them in

different ways.

I've got some amazing costumes

that I was really hoping

to be able to show off.

My husband did all--

I made the gown and

then my husband did this,

thousands and thousands of

Swarovski crystals

all applied by hand.

And I'm really disappointed

that I'm not

gonna get to show them!

Gowns with capes

and corsets.

And gloves.

And I'm also disappointed

that I'm not gonna get to do

Joan Rivers in the

Snatch Game.

'Cause I would have killed

at the Snatch Game

as Joan Rivers.

I'm gonna start crying now.

"Charlie I love you so much.

You have a new friend,

sister, and fan in me forever.

Can't wait for the

bottle or two of wine

in New York City."

Sasha with her phone

number.

"Charlie, it's been such

a pleasure getting to know you.

I thought it was shorter

than I would've liked.

You have made a

lasting impression on me."

Shea.

"Leave me that blue

wig, Aja.

Thank you for being such a

great person and queen

this whole time.

It was a pleasure getting

to know you.

I hope to work with you

soon in the future."

Surprisingly, Aja's handwriting

is really, really neat.

I expected like really

erratic.

[growling]

Aja well done!

I made some real connections

with some of the girls.

And um...

I was so amazed to meet

some really talented people.

I love being in a room

full of creative,

energetic people.

And to watch them going

about it in a different way

from the way I go

about it is really exciting.

And just to be part of that

creative process

with really talented

people and to hold my own,

at least for a short time.

That was really a

highlight.

I'm incredibly grateful for the

opportunity to be here.

Bye crazy ass work room!

And I'm a perfect example

of someone

who was worked hard for

a long time

and it didn t happen

overnight for me.

But I never gave up.

If Charlie, at fifty-two

can get on,

hopefully I represent the

fact that maybe

sometimes later in life

is when your dream comes true

and that's when it was

meant to come true.

Bye Hamburger Mary!

Oh!

This is it, this is time

for me to go!

Well this has been

an adventure!

-Bye, we're gonna

miss you!

We cannot wait to see

what you're gonna do.

-I can't wait to see you at

the premiere.

-Thank you very much.

-Good luck with everything.

-I'll be wearing something I

made, something fabulous.

Bye!

I'm coming home, James!

Bye!

-Bye Charlie, see you soon!
