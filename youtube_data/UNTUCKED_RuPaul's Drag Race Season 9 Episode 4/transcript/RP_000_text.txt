RP_001, Yes! Oh my God Shea and I won working together.
RP_002, Finally, a win!
RP_003, I am so happy, yes!
RP_004, We've had three challenges, I've been safe the whole time.
RP_005, And while I feel confident that I've turned some really cool looks so far, being safe is a scary place 'cause you don t know if you're forgettable or if you're just doing well and coasting through the competition.
RP_006, What a solid team. And also con-drag-ulations to Aja for picking such a good group of girls.
RP_007, Well honestly, this is a wake up call for me in so many ways.
RP_008, Like I've just felt so in my head and I feel so good right now, I listened to the critiques.
RP_009, You are so beautiful and you are just like accentuating that in the full, true queen that you are.
RP_010, It's just really hard to like embrace like my natural features because like all my life I've just been told that I was ugly for my natural features.
RP_011, And when I first started doing drag like, you know, like if I were to paint like a face like Farrah's or Valentina's is very soft and blended, people come up to me and be like "Oh what are you doing? Like you look ugly. Like nothing's gonna help that face, like oh you need fillers. Oh you need this, you need that."
RP_012, Like you know, people would make fun of my skin. And like my scars.
RP_013, I've always struggled with the idea of beauty.
RP_014, Because there's such a pressure to fit a certain image.
RP_015, And the reality is, we don t have to fit the image.
RP_016, Beauty has no identity, so I have to feel confident and maybe channel that in myself.
RP_017, It feels really good because last week I was in a dark place.
RP_018, Being that constructing clothes is like you know, my trade.
RP_019, I at least wanted to be in the top.
RP_020, And then to just be safe, I was like-- And I didn t even look on the bright side that I was at least moving forward in the competition.
RP_021, It wasn t like I was lip syncing. You know what I'm saying?
RP_022, So it's all about perspective and I think that as long as we can all maintain that and realize that we are like here for a reason that we just have to do our best.
RP_023, I think that we'll all be really successful going forward in the competition.
RP_024, Oh God.
RP_025, I don t want to think about it.
RP_026, I don t want to see Peppermint go.
RP_027, 'Cause I love Peppermint's energy so much.
RP_028, I can't imagine this group of girls without her.
RP_029, She wasn t a good group leader.
RP_030, Well I chose Trinity 'cause she was our team captain.
RP_031, Also because of the critiques that they got as anchors.
RP_032, And I chose you over Peppermint only because to me, as a leader, you automatically get more responsibility for something going wrong, especially if it's your group.
RP_033, You see what I'm saying?
RP_034, I'm not upset that you picked me at all. I completely--
RP_035, Well you retaliated like you were pretty upset.
RP_036, I take responsibility for the things that I did wrong in our segment.
RP_037, But what I don t agree with, and what I think you're very shady about--
RP_038, It's not shady if it's true.
RP_039, You said that I was not a good leader.
RP_040, I was a good leader, yes we ran out of time and we did not get to do it all together.
RP_041, But that wasn t just my fault, we were working as a team.
RP_042, That is why you're shady.
RP_043, Am I shady?
RP_044, Because I feel like you want to immediately want to go to shady versus stepping up and accepting responsibility.
RP_045, You're making it about something else that it's not.
RP_046, When we sat down, I felt like it was, "Well me and Peppermint are the anchors, they're gonna do this 'cause they want to do that. Nina, Eureka, y'all are dong D.I.Y."
RP_047, No. You're done because I'm gonna tell you why you're done.
RP_048, I explained exactly why I picked you for that role and Cucu for that role.
RP_049, They could have objected and we could have talked it out.
RP_050, So don't stand on the stage and say I didn t do my job because I did.
RP_051, That I should take responsibility and I should be on the bottom because I'm the leader, I can do that.
RP_052, But don t say I didn t do my job!
RP_053, I felt like I wasn t included.
RP_054, You and Peppermint--
RP_055, You always think you're not included.
RP_056, You think I don t know, I know you.
RP_057, You don t know me baby.
RP_058, Well she successfully was put back into place, honey.
RP_059, Trinity, I want to know if you like actually cared about what your group thought and let them pick what they wanted to do.
RP_060, Because our group, we did so well because Aja let us read through all the parts and like pick what we felt like we would be strong as.
RP_061, We all did parts that we related to.
RP_062, 'Cause the word that was thrown around in the work room, and I'm just gonna be real, was that you were a dictator.
RP_063, Well this is the part about being a leader, is that you have to make decisions.
RP_064, So I made decisions based on the personalities of the people and what I thought that they would excel at.
RP_065, She obviously is a crafty queen.
RP_066, She makes sickening stuff out of paper.
RP_067, Why would she not excel in that aspect?
RP_068, I knew that her personality with the way Eureka's personality is, they would be able to interact really well together.
RP_069, It just sounds like dictator-y.
RP_070, I think it's your look. You have a very serious like bitch, don t fuck with me.
RP_071, I've got fifty units of Botox in my face girl!
RP_072, I don t know what y'all want from me.
