Ladies, I have to ask something. And I hate to be morbid, yadda-yadda. But who do y'all think is gonna go home tonight?
Oh God.
Peppermint might be in trouble.
I don t want to think about it.
I don t want to see Peppermint go.
I don t either!
But I think she's in trouble.
'Cause I love Peppermint's energy so much.
I can't imagine this group of girls without her.
She's also, Sasha, a legend. Like I remember growing up in New York City. And I remember as a little like you know, middle schooler, high schooler, getting the free gay magazines and flipping through them and seeing Peppermint in the magazines. So she's like a legend on our season.
She is a legend.
I think Trinity might be in trouble 'cause she wasn t a good group leader.
This is also based on what we've heard.
Yeah.
I want to hear this coming out of the group and them.
Yeah, I'd like to hear things--
They've been gone for awhile!
They must be getting it really hard in there.
