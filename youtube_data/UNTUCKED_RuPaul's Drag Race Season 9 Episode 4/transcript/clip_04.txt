Well I chose Trinity 'cause she was our team captain. Also because of the critiques that they got as anchors. And I chose you over Peppermint only because to me, as a leader, you automatically get more responsibility for something going wrong, especially if it's your group. You see what I'm saying?
I'm not upset that you picked me at all. I completely--
Well you retaliated like you were pretty upset.
If you would let me finish. I take responsibility for the things that I did wrong in our segment. But what I don t agree with, and what I think you're very shady about--
It's not shady if it's true.
You said that I was not a good leader. I was a good leader, yes we ran out of time and we did not get to do it all together. But that wasn t just my fault, we were working as a team. That is why you're shady.
Am I shady?
You are shady.
Because I feel like you want to immediately want to go to shady versus stepping up and accepting responsibility.
You're making it about something else that it's not.
When we sat down, I felt like it was, "Well me and Peppermint are the anchors, they're gonna do this 'cause they want to do that. Nina, Eureka, y'all are dong D.I.Y."
No, I said--
No I'm not done, I'm not done.
No. You're done because I'm gonna tell you why you're done. I explained exactly why I picked you for that role and Cucu for that role.
But see, you're not hearing yourself saying "I picked. I picked."
They could have objected and we could have talked it out. So don't stand on the stage and say I didn t do my job because I did.
When did you come over and check on what we were doing?
That I should take responsibility and I should be on the bottom because I'm the leader, I can do that. But don t say I didn t do my job!
I felt like I wasn t included. You and Peppermint-- You always think you're not included! You think I don t know, I know you.
You don t know me baby!
