DY001,Hilary O'Neil had little experience and a lot of possibility.
DY002,do you know anything about chemotherapy.
DY003,well I need help during it.
DY004,so why would you pick me? Oh.. I got it. I had this shortest skirt  huh?
DY005,oh actually no there was one with a shorter skirt but he was never a candy striper.
DY006,Victor at all life could offer except the one thing he needed.
DY007,I don't think I can deal with this.
DY008,I'm not going to die  I am going to recover but I can't do it without help  I can't do it without you.
DY009,for them the best medicine in life is knowing that there's hope.
DY010,we deserve an adventure.
DY011,why don't you drive? 
DY012,no please don't do that Hilary.
DY013,he's very sick and I don't know how to help him.
DY014,Where's my son?
DY015,I think you need to come get him now.
DY016,I'd like to hide away here  too  with a beautiful girl. It's the enchanted cottage.
DY017,I'm taking you back.
DY018,Do you love me?
DY019,What?
DY020,Just tell me. 
DY021,You want me to tell you I love you? Then you can say  "Well  great. Now I'm gonna die and I'm gonna leave you."
DY022,Do you think I want to die ? 
DY023,I need a life. I have a life with you. 
DY024,Most people live a lifetime and never love like this.
RO001,Special forces  huh? Huh?

RO007,Hey pop. Got somebody I want you to meet.
RO008,I like you're dad  he loves you. I can tell even if you can't.
RO009,The way people act around you it's like they're scared of you.
RO010,Want you to get your hands off me.
RO011,What if you're scared of what I used to be.
RO012,You don't scare me John.
RO013,Well you scare me.
RO014,I gotta go back.
RO015,Just like that.
RO016,So where are they gonna send you? Right in the middle of it all?

RO023,Dear John.
RO024,I miss you so much. It hurts
RO025,Request for permission to extend my tour sir.
RO026,You've decided you're going back.
RO027,All I know is I want to stay here with you as long as I possibly can and I need you to tell me  I don't...
RO028,A lot can happen in 12 months John.
RO029,Tonight you're here with me.
RO030,My dad and I used to come out here. Lay down watch the lights change watch them go from green to red to yellow. You could try it if you wanted to.
RO031,No.
RO032,That's your problem. You don't do what you want.
RO033,Okay. And what happens if a car comes?
RO034,We die.
RO035,Some of  romances  there's shooting stars. Spectacular moment of light from the heavens.
RO036,You just tell what you want I'm gonna be that for you.
RO037,Leaving glimpse of eternity.

RO043,Do you promise?
RO044,I promise.
RO045,You sent the police for me?
RO046,It is 2:00 in the morning we sent the police.
RO047, Mrs. Hamilton  all of these is my fault.
RO048,He's a nice boy  but he's...
RO049,He's what?
RO050,He is trash trash trash not for you.
RO051,If you are not to see him anymore  and that's fine.
RO052,He understands  it's hard  but he really does.
RO053,Moods of plantation  dream house  would be able to get it now?
RO054,I think a lot about why we should get married. I love you  marry me.
RO055,Hello.
RO056,We really loved each other didn't we.
RO057,I hope you make the right choice.
RO058,Gandhi said whatever you do in life will be insignificant. It's very important that you do.
RO059,Officer those two we're just trying to stop it.
RO060,Go home.
RO061,I tend to agree with the first part.
RO062, You could do worse than have a father who bails you out of jail.
RO063,I don't want to be bailed out of anything.
RO064,Why do you think that doesn't want to spend time with me.
RO065,She knows I'll take care of her  that's all there is Tyler.
RO066,That's all there is  not enough.
RO067, You know you can't smoke in here.
RO068,What? why do you have an ashtray?
RO069,It's a bowl  it completes the room.
RO070, I guess it was just here to teach me.
RO071,You put it ghost a past couple of weeks  all right. You didn't want to go out any more.
RO072, I had enough of this introvert stuff  okay. I already set an intervention here.
RO073,He had got a daughter.
RO074,Who's got a daughter?
RO075,The cop that busted your face all up  he's got a daughter.
RO076, I know her she's in my global politics class.
RO077,Go get her.
RO078,I I don't date sociology majors.
RO079,Lucky for you  I'm I'm undecided.
RO080,About what?
RO081,Of everything.
RO082,What desserts do you have?
RO083, I have my dessert first.
RO084,What is that?
RO085,This is our appetizer.
RO086,That's my chicks dig...You man they love this freaky poetic stuff.
RO087,Charles it's your son.
RO088,Yeah  I was wondering if you wanna have dinner.
RO089,How many?
RO090,Three.
RO091,Can stand me up  but he can't stand you up.
RO092,You gonna take care of nothing! You're irresponsible for no one! You're a kid!
RO093,I'm going out.
RO094,Where are you going?
RO095,A boy from school.
RO096,You're kind of lost  don't you?
RO097,You think you know me  you know.
RO098,My dad just doesn't know what's going on right now.
RO099,What's going on right now?
RO100,Someone's been trying to tell me something  make your yours forever. No marking on the forever part.
RO101,You do not like this song.
RO102,You have to turn it off.
RO103,Please stop.
RO104,Life's all about moments of impact  but what if one day you could no longer remember any of them.
RO105,Paige you're in the hospital you were in a car accident.
RO106,Are you in any pain?
RO107,My head hurts doctor.
RO108,She doesn't remember me!
RO109,Her memory is going to improve with time.
RO110,Surprise!
RO111,We miss you.
RO112,Coming home to life  I don't know that's a lot to take in.
RO113,We'll figure this out together.
RO114,Good morning.
RO115,What?
RO116,Please knock.
RO117,This's habit  I'm sorry
RO118,The last memory that I have is being engaged to Jeremy.
RO119,Hi.
RO120,Hi. I'm sorry. This is ah...
RO121,Jeremy.
RO122,Been a long time.
RO123,I need to make my wife fall in love with me again. I want to ask you out on a date.
RO124,This is the exact parking spot where we first met.
RO125,I know you remember what we were like together.
RO126,You like this  right?
RO127,I'm trying!
RO128,To save what we have.
RO129,I'm not trying to hurt you.
RO130,I miss our life together  I miss being with you.
RO131,I hope one day I can love the way that you love me.
RO132,You figured it out once  you'll do it again.
RO133,New York has lost its soul.
RO134,He's decided to hate where he's from.
RO135,There's a John Varvatos where CGB's used to be.
RO136,That's true.
RO137,New York's most vibrant neighborhood at the moment is Philadelphia.
RO138,W.F. Gerald. I just moved into 2-b.
RO139,Thomas Webb.
RO140,Why so troubled  Thomas?
RO141,I'm having a bad day.
RO142,What's her name?
RO143,I'm crazy about you.
RO144,I'm crazy about you but...
RO145,But  don't say his friends.
RO146,Why?! Why is that so bad?
RO147,What you need to do just make her afraid of something more than being with you.
RO148,Which is..
RO149,Not being with you.
RO150,How am I supposed to do that?
RO151,Let life take over  find a window and bounce.
RO152,What's my father doing here?
RO153,Who's he with?
RO154, I don't know. It's not my mother.
RO155,That's her  the other woman.
RO156,Excuse me! Do you know who I am?
RO157,Yes I do.
RO158,You do?
RO159,You're the boy who follows me. You're also Ethan's son.
RO160,You think you're gonna steal him away from my mother  and get any man you want to sit.
RO161,Could I get you?
RO162,What?
RO163,She's not like anyone I've ever met.
RO164,People do things all the time without realizing.
RO165,Yeah  what am I doing?
RO166, You're trying to make love to me.
RO167,I'm trying to make love to you?
RO168,We're you?
RO169,What kind of a question is that?
RO170,She's a beautiful woman.
RO171,She's sleeping with my father.
RO172,You're being really obvious.
RO173,You're an innocent Thomas and you've got no idea how the world works.
RO174,I know some things.
RO175,Like what?
RO176,Did you sleep with her?
RO177,Why do you care?
RO178,In life what is it that you want?
RO179,Is there anything I should know? Anything you want to tell me.
RO180,You want something more here.
RO181,Something more what?
RO182,Provocative.
RO183,Things have gotten messy.
RO184, You are just like them. They won  Thomas.
RO185,I want to bail  but I can't.
RO186,But then you know  the only way out is truth.
RO187,It's as random as it is deliberate. Funny as it is tragic.
RO188,Yours is no exception.
RP001,Yes! Oh my God Shea and I won working together.
RP002,Finally  a win!
RP003,I am so happy  yes!
RP004,We've had three challenges  I've been safe the whole time.
RP005,And while I feel confident that I've turned some really cool looks so far  being safe is a scary place 'cause you don t know if you're forgettable or if you're just doing well and coasting through the competition.
RP006,What a solid team. And also con-drag-ulations to Aja for picking such a good group of girls.
RP007,Well honestly  this is a wake up call for me in so many ways.
RP008,Like I've just felt so in my head and I feel so good right now  I listened to the critiques.
RP009,You are so beautiful and you are just like accentuating that in the full  true queen that you are.
RP010,It's just really hard to like embrace like my natural features because like all my life I've just been told that I was ugly for my natural features.
RP011,And when I first started doing drag like  you know  like if I were to paint like a face like Farrah's or Valentina's is very soft and blended  people come up to me and be like "Oh what are you doing? Like you look ugly. Like nothing's gonna help that face  like oh you need fillers. Oh you need this  you need that."
RP012,Like you know  people would make fun of my skin. And like my scars.
RP013,I've always struggled with the idea of beauty.
RP014,Because there's such a pressure to fit a certain image.
RP015,And the reality is  we don t have to fit the image.
RP016,Beauty has no identity  so I have to feel confident and maybe channel that in myself.
RP017,It feels really good because last week I was in a dark place.
RP018,Being that constructing clothes is like you know  my trade.
RP019,I at least wanted to be in the top.
RP020,And then to just be safe  I was like-- And I didn t even look on the bright side that I was at least moving forward in the competition.
RP021,It wasn t like I was lip syncing. You know what I'm saying?
RP022,So it's all about perspective and I think that as long as we can all maintain that and realize that we are like here for a reason that we just have to do our best.
RP023,I think that we'll all be really successful going forward in the competition.
RP024,Oh God.
RP025,I don t want to think about it.
RP026,I don t want to see Peppermint go.
RP027,'Cause I love Peppermint's energy so much.
RP028,I can't imagine this group of girls without her.
RP029,She wasn t a good group leader.
RP030,Well I chose Trinity 'cause she was our team captain.
RP031,Also because of the critiques that they got as anchors.
RP032,And I chose you over Peppermint only because to me  as a leader  you automatically get more responsibility for something going wrong  especially if it's your group.
RP033,You see what I'm saying?
RP034,I'm not upset that you picked me at all. I completely--
RP035,Well you retaliated like you were pretty upset.
RP036,I take responsibility for the things that I did wrong in our segment.
RP037,But what I don t agree with  and what I think you're very shady about--
RP038,It's not shady if it's true.
RP039,You said that I was not a good leader.
RP040,I was a good leader  yes we ran out of time and we did not get to do it all together.
RP041,But that wasn t just my fault  we were working as a team.
RP042,That is why you're shady.
RP043,Am I shady?
RP044,Because I feel like you want to immediately want to go to shady versus stepping up and accepting responsibility.
RP045,You're making it about something else that it's not.
RP046,When we sat down  I felt like it was  "Well me and Peppermint are the anchors  they're gonna do this 'cause they want to do that. Nina  Eureka  y'all are dong D.I.Y."
RP047,No. You're done because I'm gonna tell you why you're done.
RP048,I explained exactly why I picked you for that role and Cucu for that role.
RP049,They could have objected and we could have talked it out.
RP050,So don't stand on the stage and say I didn t do my job because I did.
RP051,That I should take responsibility and I should be on the bottom because I'm the leader  I can do that.
RP052,But don t say I didn t do my job!
RP053,I felt like I wasn t included.
RP054,You and Peppermint--
RP055,You always think you're not included.
RP056,You think I don t know  I know you.
RP057,You don t know me baby.
RP058,Well she successfully was put back into place  honey.
RP059,Trinity  I want to know if you like actually cared about what your group thought and let them pick what they wanted to do.
RP060,Because our group  we did so well because Aja let us read through all the parts and like pick what we felt like we would be strong as.
RP061,We all did parts that we related to.
RP062,'Cause the word that was thrown around in the work room  and I'm just gonna be real  was that you were a dictator.
RP063,Well this is the part about being a leader  is that you have to make decisions.
RP064,So I made decisions based on the personalities of the people and what I thought that they would excel at.
RP065,She obviously is a crafty queen.
RP066,She makes sickening stuff out of paper.
RP067,Why would she not excel in that aspect?
RP068,I knew that her personality with the way Eureka's personality is  they would be able to interact really well together.
RP069,It just sounds like dictator-y.
RP070,I think it's your look. You have a very serious like bitch  don t fuck with me.
RP071,I've got fifty units of Botox in my face girl!
RP072,I don t know what y'all want from me.
