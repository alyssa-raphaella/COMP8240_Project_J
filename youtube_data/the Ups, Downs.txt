mountain the highest point of my life

thus far

[Music]

layout one and we're wearing theopo

wearing off-white ex adidas shirt

[Music]

that's very doing her thing

[Music]

valley the lowest point of my life thus

far

i think right now i'm treading through a

long silent

uncertain damp sticky weird valley

and it sucks life sucks

sometimes but if you look in the bible

god actually allows his people to be

in the valley in the wilderness and

exile when he wants to teach them a

lesson

or when he wants to prepare them for

something big that's coming up

if there was something that i was very

much fixated on it was

why i was here why i couldn't be

committed and why i was so distracted

but that's the problem i was so fixated

on why i was here

instead of what i could do to get out of

it

and to be disciplined is not like the

big goal my dad was telling me do you

want to live a life

so that when you die on your tombstone

when it says

here lay a disciplined woman no that's

not the point of it

the lord disciplines those that he loves

and i can definitely feel god's love

right now but the discipline

is done in order for us to look to him

and this is the way that i look at it

if i don't learn the habits now if i

don't discipline myself now

or if i don't learn the lessons that i'm

supposed to learn right now

when god eventually gives me that big

blessing that he's been preparing me for

i won't be able to hold it with ease

i'll probably drop it because i wasn't

disciplined enough to learn how to

balance

i'll probably break it because i didn't

learn the discipline of

being gentle if you do feel like you are

in a sucky situation at the moment where

things feel uncertain and just

i read this somewhere it says if you

refuse to change your bad habits

start being happy with your results

because i'm not happy with this result

and i know that god doesn't want to keep

me in this uh

result so with his help

and with my determination to change

consistent and little steps

are gonna get us out so come at me world

what doesn't kill you makes you stronger

after it gives you a mental breakdown

and hey

just saying praise report okay

this script of mine looked very

different

a few days ago talking about the valley

talking about being disciplined

but i actually asked for help

i told someone what i was going through

and i asked for advice

thank you dad river what i'm looking

forward to

if we talk about the characteristics of

a valley someone's gonna tell you it's

dab it's dark it's

though it's uh i really love uh for some

reason why am i using that so many times

but there are other characteristics of a

valley because of the u-shape or

v-shaped position that it has

all of the goodness all of the rain all

the water all of the minerals from the

mountain top

is actually eroded and brought down into

the valley

so this is the place that has the most

fertile soil

it is the place where the most beautiful

grass grows

it is a place where a river is formed

when i graduated from high school the

philippines was just this oasis of

opportunities you know

youtube just started suddenly brands

wanted to work with me and i was

discovering my love for filmmaking and

so many opportunities but my mind was

very small

i didn't know a lot of things i didn't

know what i wanted

and i didn't have a lot of tools in my

tool belt i didn't have the skills to

get me to where i wanted to be

my mind was small the opportunities were

big then i moved to australia and my

mind is just

bursting at its seams i just want to do

everything i just want to get everything

done but the opportunities were oh

so limited i didn't know who to work

with i wasn't integrated in that

industry

i didn't even know where to begin and

yes i did have class which was a good

thing because i was able to explore

myself there my creativity

but it was still for the most part quite

limited because it was only within a

school setting

and i had a rubric that i had to follow

i had to do this

and i had to do this and i could only

shoot at this frame rate

my mind was big my opportunities were

not as

moving back to the philippines the

opportunities

are so big right now

because there is no more borders as to

what

technology can do like honestly

but my mind the dreams that god has

placed onto my heart

are absolutely endless

and what's so beautiful about these

dreams is that they actually scare me

and they scare me because i know that i

can't do it by myself

but they excite me because i know that

god is the only one that's going to be

able to

make it come into fruition so i have a

lot of things that i'm looking forward

to

you know the valley has the most fertile

soil as i mentioned a while ago

and so this is the perfect place to

plant right now it is the perfect place

for me to start all those projects that

i wanted to start

i'm planting seeds i'm making the

necessary commitments

i am making relationships and connecting

opportunities with this opportunities

and whatnot

and sometimes it's frustrating when

those planted things are not blooming

yet

but it takes time but as that river

continues to water

those seeds holy moly so many things are

going to come

october 2 i have a new song coming out

consistent youtube videos
