Con-drag-ulations!
You guys literally almost had me pissing!
Pissing myself!
I think Farrah and I were like wetting ourselves underneath that desk. To the ladies of "Good Morning Bitches" and especially Shea and Sasha. Con-drag-ulations on your win!
Yes!
To Shea and Sasha!
Con-drag-ulations.
Ladies.
What a solid team. And also con-drag-ulations to Aja for picking such a good group of girls.
You picked the team, bitch!
Well honestly, this is a wake up call for me in so many ways. Like I've just felt so in my head and I feel so good right now, I listened to the critiques.
Look at you, you today, you look--
You look beautiful!
You look like you're not--you're not afraid of your face.
Yeah.
And trying to hide it. You are so beautiful and you are just like accentuating that in the full, true queen that you are.
It's just really hard to like embrace like my natural features because like all my life I've just been told that I was ugly for my natural features. And when I first started doing drag like, you know, like if I were to paint like a face like Farrah's or Valentina's is very soft and blended, people come up to me and be like "Oh what are you doing? Like you look ugly. Like nothing's gonna help that face, like oh you need fillers. Oh you need this, you need that." Like you know, people would make fun of my skin. And like my scars.
I've always struggled with the idea of beauty. Because there's such a pressure to fit a certain image. And the reality is, we don t have to fit the image. Beauty has no identity, so I have to feel confident and maybe channel that in myself.
Now Shea, you've been in the top before and now you have your first win. How does that feel?
Yes!
It feels really good because last week I was in a dark place. Being that constructing clothes is like you know, my trade. I at least wanted to be in the top. And then to just be safe, I was like-- And I didn t even look on the bright side that I was at least moving forward in the competition. It wasn t like I was lip syncing. You know what I'm saying?
We're all ambitious.
Yeah.
So it's all about perspective and I think that as long as we can all maintain that and realize that we are like here for a reason that we just have to do our best. I think that we'll all be really successful going forward in the competition.
I agree.
