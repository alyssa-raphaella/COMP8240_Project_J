I know, I understand like it must be difficult like to be in the positon you're in. But like, girl just--
I'm completely relaxed. 'Cause this is the thing-
Yeah.
I really believe that everything happens for a reason. And if I'm meant to go home then I'm gonna go home.
I know but I know. But you say you're relaxed but you just seem like you're like coming off strong.
I am, but that's just my personality. I am very stand offish. It's taken a lot for me to open up to people. I am very like "don't talk to me". Not that I mean it that way, but that's how I- how I come across the way I look to people. People don t know where I came from. People don't know the things that I've been through in my life to make me the way that I am. So it's something I struggle with everyday. I try.
If it means anything to you, like I can't say I have completely walked in your shoes but I can say that I do understandlike how it is to kind of carry, like I came here carrying a lot of weight on my shoulders with a lot of different things back at home. And I know like I was in the bottom last week and it really sucks.
Right.
But just don't overthink it.
If I stay, that's something that I'm definitely going to carry over to the next part of the competition is not overthinking stuff.
